      <h4>About Dick</h4>
      <p>
        For the guy who directed The Tonight Show and Wheel of Fortune, he has a surprisingly small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Carson" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> entry. It's also really
        difficult to find much information on him, but he's actually really important as a director.
